## Camera API Test (iOS & Android)
- Purpose: To ensure the WebView cannot access the device camera without explicit permission.
- Importance: Prevents unauthorized camera access, protecting user privacy.
- Expected Result: The test should fail if the camera is accessed without permission.

This script attempts to access the device's camera through the browser's getUserMedia API, and then evaluates the outcome to determine if the camera started streaming without user permission. It operates within a webview common to both iOS and Android, relying on the browser's standardized API to function consistently across different operating systems.

The cross-platform compatibility is possible because the script is written in JavaScript, using the Web APIs (specifically navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia) that are supported by modern web browsers, including the webviews used within native iOS and Android applications. This standardization allows the same code to request camera access and handle user permissions in a consistent manner, regardless of the underlying operating system.

## File System Access Test (iOS)
- Purpose: To verify the WebView cannot access the local file system.
- Importance: Prevents unauthorized access to files on the device, protecting user data.
- Expected Result: The test should pass only if the attempt to access the local file system is blocked.

The testFileSystemIOS function attempts to access a sensitive system file on iOS devices using an XMLHttpRequest; if the file is accessible (request succeeds), it's considered a security failure, whereas inability to access (request fails) indicates a secure environment

## JavaScript Bridge Test
- Purpose: To check if the WebView restricts the use of the JavaScript bridge to only authorized message handlers.
- Importance: Prevents execution of unauthorized JavaScript, protecting the app from potentially malicious code.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if messages cannot be posted to unauthorized handlers.

## Automatic Phone Call Test
-Purpose: To confirm the WebView cannot initiate phone calls automatically.
-Importance: Prevents malicious automatic calls, protecting the user from fraud and unexpected charges.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if automatic phone calls cannot be initiated.

## Spoof Address Bar
- Purpose: To verify that the WebView is not susceptible to address bar spoofing.
- Importance: Ensures users can trust the URL displayed, preventing phishing attacks.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if address bar content cannot be altered deceptively.

## Secure Context Test
- Purpose: To check if the WebView enforces secure contexts (HTTPS).
- Importance: Ensures data integrity and confidentiality through encryption, protecting user data from man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if the page is loaded in a secure context.

The function testSecureContext() is used to check if the web content loaded in your app's WebView is being displayed in a secure context. If it's not, this could be a sign that your app is vulnerable to eavesdropping or tampering, particularly if sensitive information is being transmitted.

By ensuring that window.isSecureContext returns true, you're taking a step to affirm that the connection is secure, encrypted, and less prone to certain kinds of attacks. This is part of best practices for maintaining the security of your users' data and your app's integrity.

## WebRTC Leak Test
- Purpose: To ensure the WebView does not leak local IP addresses through WebRTC.
- Importance: Protects user identity and location, preventing potential tracking or targeted attacks.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if no local IP leak is detected.

## Clipboard API Test
- Purpose: To verify the WebView cannot access the deviceâ€™s clipboard without permission.
- Importance: Prevents unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data copied to the clipboard.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if clipboard content cannot be accessed without explicit user action.

## GLB File UXSS Test
- Purpose: To confirm that the WebView is not vulnerable to Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) via malicious GLB files.
- Importance: Prevents execution of malicious scripts, protecting the app and user data from cross-site scripting attacks.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if no script execution is detected from the GLB file.

## Mixed Content Test
- Purpose: To verify that the WebView blocks insecure content on a secure page.
- Importance: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring data integrity by blocking potentially malicious content.
- Expected Result: The test should pass if mixed content is blocked.
